# Movies-show-API-DDD

This demo project primarily implements domain-driven design (DDD) concepts. It follows the principles of clean architecture to ensure a clear separation of concerns and maintainability. The project structure is organized to promote scalability and testability, making it easier to manage and extend.

## Key Features:
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The core business logic is encapsulated within the domain layer, ensuring that the business rules are the primary focus.
- **Clean Architecture**: The project is structured to separate the application into distinct layers, including the domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers. This separation helps in managing dependencies and promotes a clean, maintainable codebase.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Used for data access, with configurations done using Fluent API to ensure precise control over the database schema.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests are provided to ensure the reliability and correctness of the business logic.
